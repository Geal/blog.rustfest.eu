# Hotels

We managed to get a deal for hotels with Z체rich Tourism.
They allocated rooms for our attendees which are 10% reduced.
The offer is valid until the end of august: [Open offer](https://www.zuerich.com/en/visit/rustfest-zuerich)

While booking hotels for Z체rich consider the following:

* Public transport is really good and the network is [very dense](/assets/posts/twirf-2/VBZ_Linienplan.pdf)
* Getting from one end of the city to the other takes around 30 minutes
* Our venue is located near the station "Z체rich, ETH/Universit채tsspital"

# Tickets

Many asked us, when will the tickets be on sale.
The first batch of tickets will be sold next week, starting 2017-07-17.
