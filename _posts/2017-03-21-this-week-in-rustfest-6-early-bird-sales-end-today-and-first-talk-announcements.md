## Last day of early birds

Just a quick reminder that our _early bird sale_ (tickets at 89EUR) _ends today_ at 7pm GMT. From then on, tickets will be sold at the regular price until April 9th. If you were tentative about coming, here are some good reasons:

## Announcing the first talks

We've started announcing the first talks we'll be hosting and will continue to announce them througout the week - two every day. [Follow us on twitter](https://twitter.com/rustfest) to learn about them first. Without further ado:

### Writing Idiomatic Libraries in Rust
_by [Pascal Hertleif](http://2017.rustfest.eu/talks/#writing-idiomatic-libraries-in-rust) (killercup)_

>The existence of libraries with nice, user-friendly interfaces is one of the most important factors when choosing a programming language. And while there are lots of books about how to write idiomatic libraries in other languages, finding the same information for Rust is more difficult. With this in mind, this talk will present several techniques that help developers take advantage of all that Rust has to offer and create idiomatic APIs: From implementing conversion traits and session types to using custom iterators and decorating built-in types.

### vagga -- containerization without daemons
_by [Paul Colomiets](http://2017.rustfest.eu/talks/#vagga-containerization-without-daemons) (tailhook)_

>For some reason Docker today is a synonym for containers. The goal of this talk is to break that myth. Vagga is full-scale containerization for development environments which has much more features suited specifically for dev. envs, in a much smaller codebase. I’ll try to explore both the essential features of vagga itself and how rust is specifically well suited for containers, including existing libraries.

### Making a game in Rust
_by [Lisa](http://2017.rustfest.eu/talks/#making-a-game-in-rust) (lislis)_
>When you’re trying to learn a new programming language it makes sense to start with a small project. A lot of developers would write an API server or a Twitter bot. When I try to learn a new language I start by writing a game. Let me show you how I wrote my first game in Rust with Piston.

### Interaction with real-world JavaScript from compiled Rust
_by [Ingvar Stepanyan](http://2017.rustfest.eu/talks/#interaction-with-real-world-javascript-from-compiled-rust) (RReverser)_
>Rust recently got an official support for asm.js and WebAssembly targets.
>
>While many have already played with it, tried to build simple hello-worlds and check the browser/Node.js console for result, there is still no well-established solution for Rust to interact with DOM API, JavaScript libraries or Node.js built-ins.
>
>During the talk we will get a glimpse on how this can be done on the low-level, how to wrap common browser APIs into a nice Rust interface and how to interact with JavaScript objects without having a native GC support in Rust (yet).
