This week we finalised the CFP. It was amazing to see many quality proposals from a variety of areas, disciplines, and backgrounds. This weekend we spent hours reviewing proposals and putting together the conference lineup. We did our best to cover both topics we yet haven't seen at Rustfest, as well as talks featuring the evolution of topics we have previously visited.

![XKCD Joke involving email backlog. Stick person 1: "Do you have any New Years Resolutions", Stick person 2: "Gonna finally finish dealing with those emails from 2008", Slugline: "As my Email backlog approaches 10 years, I' m starting to have doubts about my approach."](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/emails.png)

We will be sending out emails to the accepted speakers over the next few days. If you submitted something please check your `SPAM` and `JUNK` folders if you haven't heard anything by Tuesday evening.

In case you submitted a proposal

# Preliminary schedule
We have 3 15 minutes slots and 12 30 minutes slots.
Starting at 8:30 we are planning a day packed with intersting talks covering everything from tinkering to computer science and industrial deployment.

# Workshops
We are working out how many worksops we can have currently.
Safe to say, we never had that many at RustFest.
