This week we finalised the CFP. It was amazing. So many good proposals to choose from.
We sent out [emails](https://www.xkcd.com/1783/) to the accepted speakers. If you submitted something please check your `SPAM` and `JUNK` folders. Some email providers introduced a new folder like `potentially SPAM` that they sometimes do not sync over [IMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol).

In case you submitted a proposal

# Preliminary schedule
We have 3 15 minutes slots and 12 30 minutes slots.
Starting at 8:30 we are planning a day packed with intersting talks covering everything from tinkering to computer science and industrial deployment.

# Workshops
We are working out how many worksops we can have currently.
Safe to say, we never had that many at RustFest.
