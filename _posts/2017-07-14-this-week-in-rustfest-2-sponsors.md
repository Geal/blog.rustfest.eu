Some weeks move the conference forward in big steps, other weeks the conference moves forward in small steps. This week was one of those small step weeks. Still, we're happy to share a few updates with you.

# CFP

Yes! [Our CFP](http://cfp.rustfest.eu/) is still open! Please consider submitting! Not everyone will be selected as a speaker, but taking time to think of a topic and put together a proposal can cause other, even unrelated, epiphanies!

Your talk could be about anything (even tangentially) Rust related, it could be about code, about stories from the trenches (of debugging), theory, or anything in between! Heck, maybe you'll even live code like our friend Pierre did in Kyiv!

# Tickets

Many asked us, when will the tickets be on sale. For Zürich we are anticipating some demand, so in the interest of making sure everyone has a chance to get a ticket we will be releasing three seperate batches at different times during the day for a week, just in case!

The first batch of tickets will be sold next week, with batches opening on:

# Hotels

After speaking with the very friendly and generous folks over at Zürich Tourism we have acquired some allocated rooms for our attendees. Best of all: **They're 10% off.**

The offer is valid until the end of august: [Open offer](https://www.zuerich.com/en/visit/rustfest-zuerich)

While booking hotels for Zürich consider the following:

* Public transport is really good and the network is [very dense](/assets/posts/twirf-2/VBZ_Linienplan.pdf).
* Getting from one end of the city to the other takes around 30 minutes.
* Our venue is located near the station "Zürich, ETH/Universitätsspital".
