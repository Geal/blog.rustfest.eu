After our meeting this week we finally made the big step: **Releasing the CFP**. How awesome is that!? Now you can submit your creative, original, and fun talk!

[**Submit your proposal or learn more here!**](http://cfp.rustfest.eu/)

Some ideas to talk about:

* Your favorite project.
* The time you found a nasty bug (and fixed it!)
* How to approach common problems.
* How to **avoid** common problems.
* Explain something most people don't understand (lifetimes? burritos?)

First time speaking? That's OK! We'd love to have you. Nervous? It's ok, we get nervous too. It'll be awesome, no worries.

## Libz Blitz

You may have heard about the Rust [libz blitz](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/05/05/libz-blitz.html). We think it's an amazing initiative, and our friends at [1aim](https://1aim.com/) agree, in an effort to support the blitz *and* help people come to RustFest we're going to be offering conference packages (hotel, ticket, and some flight costs) to 15 participants who sign up to help with the initiative.
