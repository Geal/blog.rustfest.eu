How about enjoying Rust in the french capital? After the adventures in Berlin, Kyiz and Zürich, it's time to put our luggages in Paris, France! We hope you'll join us on **May 26th and October 27th, 2018** at the incredible [**Espace Saint-Martin**](http://espacesaintmartin.com/fr/contact/) in the center of Paris.

**What is Rustfest again?** It's a two day conference involving one day of workshops, and one day of talks! We aim for a diverse set of talks: technical and non-technical, advanced and beginner friendly content, live coding, panel, or slide based. If you like Rust, the community, or just hacking in general we aim to have something to appeal to you. This year the conference will host up to 300 awesome folks.

**Want to attend?** Pencil in the date in your calendar! We'll release a few ticket batches to ensure you get a chance to get your ticket. In the meantime, why not explore hotel/AirBNB options as well as things to do?

**Need to convince your boss?** Some talking points: Rustfest is the *only* non-US based conference regarding the Rust programming language. We are a community conference with affordable tickets, and we can issue invoices to companies. Talks can be found online for [Berlin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI4RG_uq-WU&list=PL85XCvVPmGQh8nWR_Z-fTmPGsUWuzb-dn), [Kyiv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHprJNUCgQ0&list=PL85XCvVPmGQhvs1Rnet_24B-AI3YSM2YG) and [Zürich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jywiVWKm1TI&list=PL85XCvVPmGQj9mqbJizw-zi-EhcpS5jTP).

**Want to speak?** The [Call for Proposals](https://cfp.rustfest.eu/) is open! We would love to hear your proposal for a talk, workshop or discussion. Make sure to submit before March 10, 23:59:00 CEST! As always, we'll be prioritizing talks not yet presented at Rustfest (or other Rust conferences).

**Haven't spoken before but want to?** Submit! It's totally okay! If we accept your talk we're happy to be your first experience. If you'd like, we're also happy to mentor you to give you some tips.

**Want to volunteer?** It's great to have a few locals who'd like to help attendees enjoy the experience. If you'd like to help guide a cohort of fellow hackers to your favorite restaurant, give directions, or just generally help out and make a bunch of awesome friends please [let us know here](https://github.com/RustFestEU/blog.rustfest.eu/issues/12).


**Barriers to participating?** Not all of us can easily attend these events for a variety of reasons. We'll be working with [Diversity Tickets](https://diversitytickets.org/) again, as well as holding an event (above) which you could participate in. If the ticket cost itself is your only barrier, let us know.

**Want to help someone else attend? Company with a budget??** We will be issuing supporter tickets as well, which will mean a second ticket is allocated to someone who could use help attending. If you can, consider helping our fellow community members.

**Want to help organize?** If you'd like to be part of our organizing team please introduce yourself and let us know at [team@rustfest.eu](mailto:team@rustfest.eu). We prefer it if team members are interested in helping for multiple events, especially if you might be interested in helping bring a Rustfest to your area.

So, we hope to see you soon in Paris! Keep hacking and remember that the compiler is your friend!
