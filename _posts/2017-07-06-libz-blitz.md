Our amazing friends at [1aim](http://1aim.com/), along with some help from the Rust core team member [Brian Anderson (brson)](https://github.com/brson/), are back at it again this time around with another way to help you get your butt to Rustfest so you can mix, mingle, and learn with other members of our community.

[This time around](http://blog.rustfest.eu/ticket-raffle), we're having a contest! It's part of the [libz blitz](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/05/05/libz-blitz.html) and is focused on getting **you** familiar with some well used creates as well as more of our community members.

**Not an experienced Rust developer?** That's ok. There is mentoring available to help guide you through the process.


**What is it like?** KodrAus recently posted about their experience with the initiative. [Find it here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/6lkuyd/my_experience_with_the_libz_blitz/) **TL;DR:** It was a great learning experience.

**What you get to do:**

- Lead the evaluation of a qualifying crate **or** fix 8 qualifying crate or cookbook issues. If you already contributed to the Libz Blitz that also counts!
- Finish your work before the 31st of August and submit your application [**here**](https://goo.gl/forms/Sgb7aAfonSzxxQUj2)

**What you get:**

- One RustFest Zürich **ticket**
- **Hotel** accomodation from the 29th of September to the 2nd of October (checkout) (provided by 1aim)
- Up to **150€** (EU participants) **250€** (non EU participants) towards your travel expenses (reimbursed with provided receipt after the conf)
- Only the first 15 applications will be accepted. You will be informed within a few days of submitting your application if you qualified.
    - *If you don't get in please feel encouraged to contribute anyways, all are welcome!*


**How to get started:**

- Decide whether you want to do a crate evaluation or work on issues.
- Pick a crate or issues from [this list]()
- Join <a href="https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.mozilla.org/?nick=libblitzer|?#rust-libs">#rust-libs</a> to get mentoring and advice.

You can also contact Brian (brson on irc) directly if you have any questions.

The main activity of the [libz blitz](lb) is evaluating key Rust crates. These evaluations are conducted by the community, on the [Rust internals forum](f), under the leadership of a "crate evaluation lead". Leading a crate evaluation is a multi-week process that involves: opening an internals thread to host the discussion, soliciting others to evaluate the crate in terms of the [Rust API guidelines](g), ensuring those guidelines are evaluated, soliciting new recipes for the [Rust Cookbook](c), filing resultant issues against the crate, and ensuring they are completed. Finally, complete a crate evaluation to get the reward.

[f]: http://internals.rust-lang.org/
[c]: http://github.com/brson/rust-cookbook

The libz blitz crate evaluations produce a handful of (usually) small-sized issues against each crate, and against the cookbook. While each issue is itself a minor improvement, in aggregate they add up to significant improvements to each crate, and ultimately, the whole crate ecosystem. Complete 8 of these issues to claim the reward.

Details about leading a crate evaluation are [here](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/rust-libz-blitz/5184/80). Ask on the thread or contact brson with any questions.

> *Note: This is our first time trying something like this, so we're excited to make mistakes and get messy trying this out with you.*


Once again, big thanks to 1aim and we’re very excited to see them (and you!) at RustFest this year!

1aim is a Berlin-based startup that develops access control systems. In layman’s terms, they build a system that can open any door with any phone. Gone are the days of RFID cards and unwieldy keychains. Instead, keys are sent digitally, making remote management a snap and temporary access simple.

In addition to 1aim’s sponsorship of last year’s Rust Fest, the company’s CTO and system architect Yann Leretaille delivered a keynote presentation. 1aim develops all of its hardware and software in-house at their offices in Berlin. They’re [actively looking](https://1aim.com/#careers) to expand their team of developers to support their Rust-powered backend.
