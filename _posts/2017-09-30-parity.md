Parity Technologies is delighted to be sponsoring Rustfest 2017!! As always we are very excited to be attending and we are facilitating lots of great workshops on Sunday 1st October, so feel free to pop by and say hello and find out all the exciting stuff that’s been going on in the world of Parity! Also, for those who know us already you will notice we have a brand spanking new logo to show off for the first time so make sure you look out for it!

On the day we will be running four workshops during the event: 

“A Beginner’s guide to AI and Machine Learning” which will be presented by Marek Kotewicz and Fredrik Harrysson
“Interacting Ethereum with Rust” facilitated by Parity Tech’s Tomasz Drwiega
“Rust in the browser with WebAssembly” will be led by Nikolay Volf and Maciej Hirsz
And last but not least, join Robert Habermeier and Jack Fransham on “Game development in Rust.” 

For more info and exact locations please refer to the Rustfest Schedule.

Parity Technologies was founded in 2015 by Dr Gavin Wood, Co-Founder of Ethereum, along with other Ethereum Alumni, including Dr Jutta Steiner. Rust development is core to our technology, so we are honoured to be supporting Rustfest this year in Zurich and we are looking forward to two fun filled days of talks and workshops!
