Thank you all for your 74 talks and 8 workshop submissions.

This means we have a preliminary schedule featuring:

Over the next days we will confirm the speakers and finalize the schedule.

## Workshops

Currently we are gathering more space for the workshops.
We will inform you as quickly as possible when we know who we can host.

# Keynote Speakers

With the `epoch = "2018"` comming up the [rust core](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/03/12/roadmap.html) focuses on productivity.
That is why we are very excited to announce Matt talking about the community in Nairobi, Kenya and Vaidehi talking about the basics of computer science in a beginner friendly way.
