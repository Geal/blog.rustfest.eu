# CFP Last Call

<div style="text-align: center">
  <strong><a class="button" href="https://cfp.rustfest.eu/events/rustfest-paris">Apply before March 17th (tomorrow!) is the CFP deadline!</a></strong>
</div>

This is your very last chance to submit a presentation to RustFest. Due to our timeline this year we won't be doing an extension. Topic not quite refined yet? Submit it! Waffling between two ideas? Submit both! Scared to submit because you might have to speak? You can do it! Trust us!

**PS** You can also submit it to [RustConf](https://cfp.rustconf.com/events/rustconf-2018)!


# Diversity Sponsorships

<div style="text-align: center">
  <strong><a class="button" href="https://diversitytickets.org/events/152">Apply before March 17th (tomorrow!) for a Diversity Ticket</a></strong>
</div>

As with previous years we are again partnering with our lovely friends at [DiversityTickets.org](https://diversitytickets.org/) to support our community members which need assistance in attending RustFest. We welcome members of underrepresented groups to apply for this support.

**Who does this include?** This includes, but is not limited to people who belong to one or more of the following groups: people of color, women, nonbinary and gender non-conforming people, disabled people, people with mental health issues, and LGBTQIA+ people.

**What is included?** Our ability to support you is primarily driven by our empathic attendees (via Diversity Sponsorships) and amazing sponsors. All selected applicants recieve a ticket, and a travel stipend to meet their needs where possible.

**Am I welcome at RustFest?** YES! Our community **wants** to meet you! That's why they're donating and coming to RustFest! There is no value in a homogenous echo chamber.

# Keynotes

We have now confirmed our two keynote speakers (and we're very, very excited about them!). We'll be announcing them officially in the next couple weeks after we collaborate and figure out the most impactful topics they can share with us.
