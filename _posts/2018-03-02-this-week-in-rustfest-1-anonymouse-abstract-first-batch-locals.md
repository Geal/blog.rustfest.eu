With some further adoo, this weeks news.

# First ticket batch

We proudly announce the first batch of regular tickets.


# Local communities

@GuillaumeGomez and @pnkfelix

# CfP process explained

The first step ist to go to [cfp.rustfest.eu](https://cfp.rustfest.eu/events/rustfest-paris) and read the long section of text.
If you agree with the process you should register an account and submit your talk or workshop.

## The anonymouse abstract

We designed our process to be as fair as possible.
With that in mind we require all submissions to be anonymouse.
The reviewers will not accept talks signed with names.

So the natural question to ask is: How can I submit a talk about my favorite crate if it is a famouse crate and everybody can attribute me?
