# First ticket batch

We proudly announce the first batch of regular tickets.


# Local communities

@GuillaumeGomez and @pnkfelix

# CfP process explained

The first step is to go to [cfp.rustfest.eu](https://cfp.rustfest.eu/events/rustfest-paris) and read the long section of text.
If you agree with the process you should register an account and submit your talk or workshop.

## The anonymous abstract

We designed our process to be as fair as possible.
With that in mind we require all submissions to be anonymous.
The reviewers will not accept talks signed with names.

If you are wondering "How can I submit a talk about my favorite crate
if it is a famous one that is easily attributed to me?", our answer
comes in two parts:

1. Please do strive to make your proposal anonymous. You can, for
example, replace the crate's name with just "CRATE" (along with a
short summary of its purpose, which is good practice to include in any
case). Accepted proposals will have the opportunity to revise their
text before we post them to the website.

2. In some cases, making the identity of a crate 100% anonymous to all
reviewers is not reasonable, e.g. because doing so would force the
proposal text to be awkward or incoherent. We advise against going to
such lengths. If some reviewer manages to *infer* your identity, then
they will be responsible to recuse themself from the review process;
but such an inference should be treated as a black mark against your
proposal.
