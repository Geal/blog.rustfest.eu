With some further adoo, this weeks news.

# First ticket batch

We proudly announce the first batch of regular tickets.


# Local communities

TODO: @GuillaumeGomez and @pnkfelix

Mozilla Paris has been hosting a [Rust meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Paris/) since 2014.
That group has over 750 registered members!

Locals from academia and industry alike have shown interest in Rust.
The Rust Paris Meetup itself was bootstrapped by local students.

# CfP process explained

The first step is to go to [cfp.rustfest.eu](https://cfp.rustfest.eu/events/rustfest-paris) and read the long section of text.
If you agree with the process you should register an account and submit your talk or workshop.

## The anonymous abstract

We designed our process to be as fair as possible.
With that in mind we require all submissions to be anonymous.
The reviewers will not accept talks signed with names.

If you are wondering "How can I submit a talk about my favorite crate
if it is a famous one that is easily attributed to me?", our answer
comes in two parts:

  1. Please remove obvious indicators of your identity. You can, for
     example, replace the crate's name with just "CRATE" (along with a
     short summary of its purpose, which is good practice to include
     in any case). Accepted proposals will have the opportunity to
     revise their text before we post them to the website.

  2. In some cases, making the identity of a crate 100% anonymous to
     all reviewers is not reasonable, e.g. because doing so would
     force the proposal text to be awkward or incoherent. We advise
     against going to such lengths. If some reviewer manages to
     *infer* your identity, then they will be responsible to recuse
     themself from the review process; but such an inference should be
     treated as a black mark against your proposal.
