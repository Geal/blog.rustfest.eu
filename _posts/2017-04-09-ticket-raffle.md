We're very happy to annouce that our friends at [1aim](http://1aim.com/) have returned as a sponsor again this year! They asked us how they could help, and we suggested they help some of our excellent attendees to get to the conference this year.

They have generously offered to cover both the **ticket** as well as **200â‚¬ of travel expenses to Kyiv** for 15 people. So if you wanted to come but couldn't *quite* afford it, well, this is your chance!

You can enter our raffle [**here**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeGlcRG1ya-g6QwaaWKycppNu4cGW5Yv_IjRxuDVq-K1F1eMQ/viewform) and we'll draw on the morning of Monday, April 17th, 2017. That means you only have a week to enter!

Once again, big thanks to 1aim and we're very excited to see them (and you!) at RustFest this year!

> 1aim is a Berlin-based startup that develops access control systems. In layman's terms, they build a system that can open any door with any phone. Gone are the days of RFID cards and unwieldy keychains. Instead, keys are sent digitally, making remote management a snap and temporary access simple.

They're actively looking to expand their team of developers to support their Rust-powered backend.
