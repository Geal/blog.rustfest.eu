</div>

For the third(!) time at RustFest our friends at 1aim are once again joining us in ZÃ¼rich! We're very excited to welcome them back. As a company that has been using Rust in production for years now 1aim brings not only altruism (see [libz blitz](http://blog.rustfest.eu/libz-blitz)) and financial stability, they also bring a huge amount of expertise that they are eager to share.

As with previous years 1aim's Yann Leretaille will be helping host our web workshop, hosted again in its traditional ad-hoc lightning-talk style. We'll talk about this more when we put up an offical list of workshops!

In the meanwhile, please whet your appetite a bit on this brief intro to the work of 1aim:

> **[1aim](https://1aim.com/)** is redefining how buildings work and how we relate to the objects around us. Theyâ€™re a people-centric company that combines excellence in mechanical, electrical and software engineering with an intelligent approach to design to create the best access control systems ever built. Each product has hardware, software and server infrastructure components. All product development is done in-house. Their flagship product is LightAccess Pro, the access control solution of the future.
>
> In addition to 1aimâ€™s sponsorship of **RustFest** the last 2 events, CTO **Yann Leretaille**, who's also the system architect, delivered a keynote presentation. **Want to join?** Theyâ€™re **[actively looking](https://1aim.com/#careers)** to expand their team of developers to support their **Rust-powered backend**.
>
> Based in Berlin, they are also behind the upcoming launch of the **[Good Technology Collective](http://goodtechnologycollective.com/)**, a group working to create awareness of the need for intelligent design and a global algorithm-literacy effort.

# Speakers: The First Three (and a workshop!)

Without further ado, here are our first three speakers as well as small abstracts about their talks:

[**Lisa 'lislis'**](https://github.com/lislis) will demonstrate the [ggez](http://ggez.rs/) framework in a *live coding session*.

> Ever wanted to make a game in Rust but didn't know where to start? Then ggez is the framework just for you! It bundles graphics and audio crates together with a simple API so can get started straight away. In this talk I want to walk you through the making of a game with ggez from empty boilerplate to publishing a playable game.

[**Andre 'llogiq' Bogus**](https://github.com/llogiq) will weave us a beautiful tale through poetry about his favorite (we hope!) language:

> This talk will take on a rather diverse set of topics, each outlined in limerick form. For each topic, a short explanation, also in rhymes (though not limerick meter), will follow where applicable. Slides will vary between code examples, rustdoc screenshots and memes.
>
> For example:
>
>
> With `unimplemented!()` confess
>
> to your users the method is less
>
> than doneâ€“you can now
>
> add a message of how
>
> to deal with the unfinished mess.
>
>
> To delve a bit more into what's new
>
> PR 42155 brought to you
>
> the way to get your message through
>
> for things that you still intend to do.

[**Geoffroy 'Geal' Couprie**](https://github.com/Geal/) will delve with us into the mysteries of macros, and together we shall all leave as macromancers:

> Many times you must reuse code
>
> And your generics aren't commode
>
> Can you deal in the macro dark arts
>
> Recompose code of similar parts
>
> Or would the compiler explode?
>
>
> Rejoice! Follow now our ways
>
> Unlock the compiler's high praise
>
> Listen here to this initiation
>
> Each eldritch arcane incantation
>
> Summons help 'gainst the terrors we face.

Yeah, bet you thought you'd only get 0 or 1 poems didn't you? Well you get **two!**

Finally, we've confirmed one of our workshops! **RustBridge** hosted by [**Ashley Williams**](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams) will be a part of our Sunday workshop day in ZÃ¼rich. This workshop will be catered towards people new to the Rust community. If this is your first blush with Rust consider attending this workshop to help you hit the ground running.

We'll be announcing further speakers (and putting up a nice schedule) soon! Keep your eyes peeled.
