# RustBridge Workshop

We are happy to announce that RustFest Paris will once again host a **RustBridge workshop**!

> RustBridge is an all-day workshop focused on getting underrepresented people with a background in another programming language to learn Rust and join the community. In this workshop we'll get you up and running with a great Rust development environment, introduce you to Rust syntax and programming concepts, and work together to build a small website that you can personalize, extend, and share!

More information can be found [on the RustBridge website][rustbridge].
The workshop will be led once again by [Ashley Williams](https://paris.rustfest.eu/sessions/rustbridge.html).

We ran RustBridge events at all past RustFests with great success and we want to continue this tradition.
Access to the workshop is free and does not require a conference ticket. However, please sign up using the provided form.

# Speaker Announcements

We received over 70 proposals this year, which made the team's job of selecting the best talks not an easy task.
Nonetheless, we finally have the schedule for RustFest Paris finished and all speakers confirmed.
We will start announcing the lineup in the coming week.
The first speakers will be announced on **Monday, 16th April, 9:00 CEST**.

[Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rustfest) and keep an eye on this blog to know about it first!

(And if you really can't wait, [we announced our keynote speakers already](/this-week-in-rustfest-3-cfp-keynote-speakers#keynote-speakers).)


# Last Ticket Batch

Together with the speaker announcements, we will release our last batch of [Standard Tickets](https://ti.to/asquera-event-ug/rustfest-paris-2018/).
It will go live on **Monday, 16th April, 9:00 CEST**.
This will be your last chance to grab one of the few remaining Standard Tickets.
