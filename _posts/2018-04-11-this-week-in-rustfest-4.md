# RustBridge

We are happy to announce that RustFest Paris will once again host a **RustBridge workshop**!

> RustBridge is a workshop focused on getting underrepresented people with a background in another programming language to learn Rust and join the community.

More information about RustBridge can be found [on the website][rustbridge].

We ran RustBridge events at all past RustFests with great success and we want to continue this tradition.
Access to the workshop is free and does not require a conference ticket. You need to signup however.
