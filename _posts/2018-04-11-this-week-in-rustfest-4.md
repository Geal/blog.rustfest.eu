# RustBridge Workshop

We are happy to announce that RustFest Paris will once again host a **RustBridge workshop**!

> RustBridge is an all-day workshop focused on getting underrepresented people with a background in another programming language to learn Rust and join the community. In this workshop we'll get you up and running with a great Rust development environment, introduce you to Rust syntax and programming concepts, and work together to build a small website that you can personalize, extend, and share!

More information can be found [on the RustBridge website][rustbridge].

We ran RustBridge events at all past RustFests with great success and we want to continue this tradition.
Access to the workshop is free and does not require a conference ticket. However, please sign up using the provided form.
