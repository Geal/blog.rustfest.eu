RustFest is a lot of hard work and community craftsmanship [citation needed](#).
For a conference this big we need additional money to support these efforts.

This week we would like to thank our main sponsor for RustFest Zürich: Parity.io

# Timely around the conference

As some of you may have heard already. 
The core team will focus the last quarter of the year 2017 on finishing all the cool projects in "rust landia".
Or the ["impl period"](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/announcing-the-impl-period-sep-18-dec-17/5676) for short.

Roughly speaking it means that around every rust conference this fall some people may work on rust and central crates near the venue for a day or two.
These "impl days" would be interesting because of the concentrated knowledge.

Imagine: You are working on a problem and use a crate.
What if you could ask the author of said crate if the crate fits the problem or how to extend it.

All of this is still very vague but: If you consider to join, maybe add a day or two after RustFest Zürich.
Worst case you will get two days of vacation time in switzerland.
