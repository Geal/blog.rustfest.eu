Have you been **procrastinating submitting to the CFP?** That's ok, we all do it! This week I procrastinated posting this TWIRF!

As you may know, our CFP was due to close today! (Oh no!) But since we didn't do an amazing job giving you warnings, and for a few other reasons, we've decided to extend our CFP until the end of July!

You should really consider submitting soon though! [**Find the CFP here**](http://cfp.rustfest.eu/).

We have had a couple people volunteer to mentor some newcomers through the process. If you happen to be in need of some guidance you can reach out to [info@rustfest.eu](mailto:info@rustfest.eu).

> But **do not** send us your proposal by mail! We review anonymously so that we don't favor anyone!
